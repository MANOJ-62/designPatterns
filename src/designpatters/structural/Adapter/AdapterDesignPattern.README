1️⃣ What is the Adapter Pattern?
The Adapter Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows two incompatible interfaces to work together.
It acts as a bridge between two different systems by converting the interface of one class into an interface that
a client expects.

2️⃣ Where is the Adapter Pattern Used?
When you want to use an existing class but its interface does not match what you need.
When you want to integrate third-party libraries with your application.
When you need to wrap a legacy system to make it compatible with modern code.
