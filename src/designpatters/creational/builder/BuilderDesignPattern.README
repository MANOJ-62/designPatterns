âœ… Builder Design Pattern in Java
The Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern used to construct complex objects step by step.
It allows the creation of objects with many optional parameters without requiring multiple constructors (avoiding the telescoping constructor problem).

ðŸš€ Why Use the Builder Pattern?
Solves the Telescoping Constructor Problem: When a class has many optional parameters, constructors can become hard to manage.
Improves Readability & Maintainability: The object creation process is more readable with method chaining.
Immutable Object Creation: Useful for constructing immutable objects like in the Effective Java Builder pattern.
Flexibility: Can be modified to include more attributes without breaking existing code.
Encapsulation of Object Construction: The builder hides the complexity of creating an object.

âœ… When to Use the Builder Pattern
When an object has many optional parameters.
When you want to make object creation more readable.
When you need immutable objects (e.g., Lombokâ€™s @Builder annotation).
When constructing an object is a multi-step process.
